        <h2>so_long</h2>
        <p>so_long is the name of the first 2d minigame I ever created within my cursus at 42.</br>Take a look!</br>
        <img src="../../assets/gif_so_long.gif" alt="so_long_gif" class="img-left"></p>
        <p>if your eyes are bleeding I'm truly sorry :)</p>
        <p>you are playing as Joe Biden and your goal is to collect oil barrels (nothing political I swear).<br>the aim of this game was for me more about the mecanics than the graphics (as you may have seen)</p>
        <h3>error management</h3>
        <p>for this game to work properly, you must sent the program a correct map. <br>the map must be a closed rectangle with at least a player, a collectible and an exit.<br>of course, the player cannot exit the map if all the collectibles are not collected.</p>
        <h3>source code</h3>
        <p>if you're intrigued, you will find the source code of this project on my dedicated <a href="https://github.com/passionroro/42cursus-so_long">github page</a>.<br>you can try the game if you're on macOS with the right environment!</p>
